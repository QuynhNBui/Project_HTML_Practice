  <p>Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii! To help with your trip planning, you need to do some climate analysis on the area. The following outlines what you need to do.</p>
  <h2> Step 1 - Climat Analysis and Exploration</h2>
  <p>To begin, use Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. All of the following analysis should be completed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. </p>
  <h2>Step 2 - Climate App</h2>
  <p>A Flask API was developed to return station, precipitation, temperature, and the temperature based on the trip date entered by users.</p>
